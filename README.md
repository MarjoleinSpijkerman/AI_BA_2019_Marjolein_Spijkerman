The program code and the test files used in my bachelor project AI

The folder names Main_Program, contains all the files of the code and the make file. 
Use the Makefile, by typing make, and then ./tree in the terminal. 
The main test set can be ran using make example2. 

The folder named Random_Formula_Generator contains the code I used for the randomly generated content.
The folder named Test_Files contains all the test sets I used in the paper. 

The main program is a tableau solver for the logic KFDE. 
First the number of inferences you are going to insert has to be inserted,
Then the amount of premises of the inference, followed by the premises and the conclusion.
The program will output whether the inference is valid or not.
